# Synthesis

The overview of this project: there is a number of available reagents; we are presenting 
an environment where an agent could add one reagent at a time (_step_) and receive a reward 
(_similarity score_) - how close a synthesised so far molecule is to a target molecule
(_target_).

You need to implement an agent in gym environment to solve this task.
